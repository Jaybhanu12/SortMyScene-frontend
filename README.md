# SortMyScene - Full Stack Ticket Booking System 🎟️

A robust, full-stack seat reservation and ticketing platform built with the MERN stack. This application ensures secure, highly-concurrent ticket bookings with a live 10-minute hold timer, atomic database transactions, and an automated background cleanup process.

**Live Application:** [https://sortmyscene-frontend.onrender.com/](https://sortmyscene-frontend.onrender.com/)

## 🚀 Live Demo Credentials

To make testing as seamless as possible, please use the following provisioned accounts on the live site:

**1. Admin Access** (For Event & Seat Management)
* **Email:** `admin@sortmyscene.com`
* **Password:** `SecureAdminPassword123!`

**2. User Access** (For Booking Flow)
* **Email:** `demo@sortmyscene.com`
* **Password:** `demo123456`

## ✨ Key Features & Add-ons

* **Real-time Seat Reservation:** Users can lock seats for exactly 10 minutes. If the timer expires, seats are immediately released back to the public pool.
* **OTP Authentication (Add-on):** Secure, production-grade OTP verification for user login/registration.
* **Admin Dashboard (Add-on):** A protected administrative control panel to create events, upload promotional images, and monitor live booking statuses.
* **Resilient UI State Machine:** A predictable 5-state frontend flow (`Selecting` → `Reserving` → `Reserved` → `Confirming` → `Confirmed`) to prevent UI tearing during asynchronous operations.

## 🧠 Architecture & Concurrency Control

This system was explicitly designed to handle high-traffic concurrency and prevent "double-booking" anomalies.

### 1. Bulletproof Concurrency (MongoDB Transactions)
Instead of relying solely on application-level pre-checks, concurrency is handled directly at the database layer. When a user attempts to reserve or confirm a seat, the system uses **MongoDB Multi-Document Transactions** combined with an **Atomic Guard Condition**. 
The write operation itself mandates that the seat's status must be strictly `available` (or owned by the specific `reservationId`) to succeed. If two identical requests hit the server at the exact same millisecond, the database engine will intentionally fail the second request, guaranteeing zero double-bookings.

### 2. Automated Seat Release (Cron Job)
Instead of blocking the event loop or relying on delayed queues, the system runs a lightweight `node-cron` job every 60 seconds (`* * * * *`). It performs a highly optimized `updateMany` query that instantly sweeps the database for any reservations where `expiresAt < now()` and flips them to `expired`. This keeps the seating grid accurate without requiring user-triggered page refreshes.
